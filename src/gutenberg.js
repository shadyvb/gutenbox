/**
 * This is the file that creates the Gutenberg assets on the Glitch CDN
 *
 * It is here for reference and reproducability. You shouldn't actually need this
 * to do any block development.
 *
 * It imports all the packages, then exports them on `window.wp`. You may need
 * to update this when a new version of Gutenberg is released. Or you can re-remix
 * the original project, it will be kept up to date with Gutenberg.
 *
 * To build this:
 *  1. Check out Gutenberg locally from https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg
 *  2. Add/remove any packages changed below
 *  3. `npm install`
 *  4. Place this file in the gutenberg root directory (same as gutenberg.php)
 *  5. Run this command: `$(npm bin)/parcel build gutenberg.js -d dist/`
 *  6. Upload the files in dist/ to the Glitch assets
 *     6a. You can update the .js and .css files' sourcemap URLs with the CDN URLs
 *  7. Update src/index.html with the new CDN URLs
 *
 * Theoretcially, this _could_ be built on Glitch, but not all packages are currently
 * published to npm and it exceeds the resource limits in tests.
